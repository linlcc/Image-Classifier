# Image classification

This project uses convolutional neural network (CNN) with pretrained model to train an image classifier. In this project, we are able to identify 102 different flower species with 92.86% accuracy in testset. This image classifier can be used to identify any new images from different sets of labeled images, e.g., flower classification, animal classification, car classification...
